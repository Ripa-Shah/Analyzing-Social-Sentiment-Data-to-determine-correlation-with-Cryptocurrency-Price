This significant selloff reflects institutional investors reducing their Bitcoin exposure amid heightened market volatility and shifting portfolio strategies. The outflow is part of a broader trend, with US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recording net outflows of approximately $492 million on the same day, signaling a reassessment of digital asset risk by institutional clients.

If it was about privacy, SOL / ETH can build that on top of their L1 and maintain industry scale. ZCash does not have nearly the same scale or speed as these other chains do and that’s real.

What ZCash has going for it is the US capitalizing on first mover advantage. We’re not accumulating Bitcoin fast enough as other countries, so what do we do? We target a chain that has a good history of fair distribution, not widely used, but based off Bitcoin from a blockchain structure + added in privacy. We load up and run this to be the next Bitcoin. That’s what I think is happening, my tin foil hat theory.

What do you think? Do you think privacy is truly what’s driving price action or is it something else? ZCash has been around for a long time, I find it hard to believe we woke up one day and said “damn, let me get some of that privacy” and took a coin to top 10/20.",0.8458

LOL. Too late, it is a CCP ASIC farm already.

>Do you think privacy is truly what’s driving price action or is it something else?

The devil is in the details. The space just wanted a runner desperately. Lots of traders got liquidated on 10/10, and they want one big trade to make it all back. Lots of alt VCs/KOLs think it is the end of the cycle, and their alt bags haven't run. Now they need to Frankenstein a leader with the correct confluence of narratives so their bags can bandwagon onto. Miners' profit margin is running low because BTC price is close to their marginal cost. Other ASIC PoW farms are not worth it for industrial miners. Many BTC miners have already pivoted to AI etc. Solana needs to wash its brand clean from all the pump fun extraction, so they can now pretend they are ""cypherpunk"".

Stars aligned for a lot of elites to fugazi a leader here.

>good history of fair distribution

On the contrary, they need to find something everyone is under-positioned on so they can make you chase out of FOMO. You think they're spamming ZEC ZEC ZEC ZEC and flooding it all over everyone's X timeline is out for fun or to create a maximal FOMO environment?

2025-11-11 19:58:26,twohundred37,comment,"McDonald's McRib Has Returned - Historically, Every McRib Comeback Since 2020 Has Marked A Bitcoin Rally",BTC,"I know correlation does not equal causation, but this really has me wondering: McDonald's uses the McRib as a tool to drive over all sales. It could always be available, but instead it is introduced sporadically in limited runs to boost sales in specific regions or to achieve some other goal that isn't simply: sell item for more than we paid for it.

What economic events trigger the decision to bring the McRib back?

# Pork Commodity Pricing Cycles

When pork prices drop, McDonald’s can lock in *extremely cheap bulk pork futures*.  
That makes the McRib **high-margin**, and they can suddenly “bring it back” as if by magic.

When pork prices are **low → McRib returns.**  
When pork prices are **high → McRib disappears.**

They’re literally arbitraging meat markets.

This is documented:  
The McRib tracks the Lean Hog Index.  
Not consumer taste.

# Q4 Earnings Pumping

The McRib almost always comes back in Q4, the quarter when:

\-companies report annual performance  
\-shareholders are watching  
\-bonuses are built on year-end performance targets

A limited-time hype item increases foot traffic across the board\*\*.\*\*

Not because everyone orders the McRib  
but because people come in to *look* at the McRib and buy fries.

So the McRib is a shareholder earnings lever

# Franchisee Morale + Participation Control

McDonald’s corporate needs *franchisees* to fall in line with menu transitions, equipment changes, and promotional cadence.

The McRib works as a compliance test.

When corporate says: ""We're doing the McRib again""

They can measure:

\-Which franchisees respond quickly  
\-Who follows operational directives smoothly  
\-Who needs pressure, rotation, or buyout

So McRib = management diagnostic tool.

# So how does this connect to Bitcoin?

The McRib tends to return when:

\-pork futures are cheap (indicates commodity downcycles)  
\-companies need Q4 performance boosts (liquidity injection season)  
\-consumer spending shifts (pre-holiday spending trends rising)

Bitcoin tends to rally when:

\-liquidity increases  
\-markets turn risk-on  
\-Q4 cycles favor speculation

So the McRib *accidentally* aligns with Bitcoin cycles…

**because they both respond to the same macroeconomic pressures.**",-0.5276

2025-11-11 18:46:04,hodorrny,post,China just accused the US of conducting a state level hack to steal 13 billion in Bitcoin - this is wild,BTC,"Chinas National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center dropped a bombshell report accusing the US government of stealing 127k Bitcoin worth around 13 billion dollars. This is getting geopolitical fast.

The Bitcoin was originally stolen from Chinas LuBian mining pool back in December 2020. At the time it was worth about 3.5 billion but the hack did not get much mainstream attention. The coins then sat in the attacker’s wallets for years and only started moving in mid 2024 before ending up in addresses that analysts and China’s report now link to US authorities, and that the DOJ says it controls as of the seizure announced in October 2025.

Chinas argument is that normal criminals would cash out immediately. The fact these coins stayed dormant for about four years points to a state level operation not some random hacker looking for quick profit. They say the sophistication of the hack and the long dormancy proves it was government orchestrated.

The US Department of Justice seized the Bitcoin in October 2025 as part of a case against Chen Zhi who ran Cambodias Prince Group. They charged him with running a massive crypto fraud and forced labor scam network and said the seizure was a lawful criminal proceeds forfeiture. The DOJ has explicitly denied China’s “state level hack” accusation and says it had no involvement in the original theft.

Heres the thing tho. Chen Zhi apparently sent multiple messages on chain basically begging the hackers to return the Bitcoin and offering ransom. The hackers never responded which is weird if they were just criminals.

Or they just chose not to sell immediately, it's not like some honor-bound criminal oath that says you have to sell immediately.

The fee was collected by MARA Pool, the mining pool that processed the transaction. The incident highlights the risks of manual input in crypto transactions, where misconfigured settings can lead to costly mistakes. While miners can choose to return fees, such reimbursements are rare. This event underscores the importance of double-checking wallet settings to avoid significant losses.

""Nothing great has ever been created by a short seller,"" Saylor said at [Yahoo Finance Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/invest2025/) on Thursday.

""I don't really think about Jim Chanos,"" he said, referencing the famed short seller who has been among the most prominent critics of the DAT boom. ""I think that there'll be some skeptics. They don't really appreciate what bitcoin is doing. They don't understand digital capital. They don't understand digital credit.""

Notable sales included $290 million worth of Bitcoin by whale Owen Gunden. The market saw $500 million in liquidations, mostly from long positions, and the Crypto Fear and Greed Index fell to 15, signaling 'extreme fear.' Other major cryptocurrencies also declined, except XRP, which saw positive momentum.

They recommend investors consider taking profits during this phase. Despite Bitcoin's recent dip below its 365-day moving average, which some analysts view as a bearish signal, institutional interest in Bitcoin as a digital asset and hedge against inflation continues to grow, supported by ETFs and regulatory advancements.

The article ends by admitting that Institutional Investors are not or cannot do any of this because of the nature of being a large investor. Admitting that they have rules in place as to making knee jerk decisions. The point being that responsible investment strategies are anchored in being deliberative and ""long"" in their business model/ investment strategies.

2025-11-09 15:19:49,emperordas,post,"Ethereum Faces Critical Scaling Issue, Vitalik Admits Mistake",ETH,"Ethereum has been highly reliant on the Zero Knowledge Solutions like ZK Rollups. It had even bought blobs, temporary storage spaces in Ethereum L1 blocks, to reduce the cost that rollups pay to finalize their transactions on Ethereum

Further, Ethereum had also bought the Dencun Upgrade on March 13, 2024 and the Pectra Upgrade on May 7, 2025 to help rollups.

However, a past legacy solution remains a critical bottleneck for Ethereum Scaling called the “modexp precompile”.

ModeXP Precompile is an algorithm that enables the execution of highly complex operations, which other protocols, such as RSA, cannot perform.

When ModeXP was created around 2017, there were no Zero Knowledge Protocols. In the current scenario, they force the Zero Knowledge Rollup to simulate the Ethereum blockchain for every transaction in a particular summary.",0.4005
2025-11-10 04:22:31,puckmugger,comment,"Ethereum Faces Critical Scaling Issue, Vitalik Admits Mistake",ETH,"Simplified explanation for the inept:

Imagine you have a busy highway (Ethereum network + its scaling layers) and you want lots of cars (transactions) to pass through quickly, cheaply. You also have some new super-fast lanes (layer 2s + ZK-rollups) to help relieve congestion. Great.

But then there’s a single toll booth (the modexp precompile) that’s super slow whenever certain kinds of cars use it. It doesn’t stop all cars, only some kinds of cars (those requiring that particular crypto operation). But because these kinds of operations are common in some of the new scaling / ZK stuff, the slow booth backs up traffic, slows everything down, and raises costs.

So even though you’ve built the super-fast lanes, the toll booth still forces many cars into a jam or makes them pay a lot more. That means your overall highway throughput (transactions per second), or cost per car (gas/fees), gets worse than potential. And the new lanes don’t work as well or as cheaply as they could.",0.7964
2025-11-09 15:20:22,coinfeeds-bot,comment,"Ethereum Faces Critical Scaling Issue, Vitalik Admits Mistake",ETH,"tldr; Ethereum is facing a critical scaling issue due to the 'modexp precompile,' an encryption algorithm created by Vitalik Buterin in 2017. This algorithm significantly slows down Zero Knowledge (ZK) rollups, which are essential for Ethereum's scalability. Vitalik admitted the algorithm was a mistake and proposed an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) to replace it with a more ZK-friendly solution. The current algorithm increases execution difficulty by up to 50 times, potentially causing consensus failures and negating the benefits of recent upgrades like Dencun and Pectra.

MSTR's market Net Asset Value (mNAV) has compressed significantly, and its implied premium has dropped, suggesting better valuation. Analysts believe this could indicate a reversal in the market, as Bitcoin treasury companies have faced significant value declines recently. The U.S. government reopening may also boost crypto market sentiment.

Qian defrauded 128,000 investors in China through a Ponzi scheme before fleeing to the UK in 2017. She lived a lavish lifestyle, evading authorities using aliases and fake passports. Her arrest followed a complex investigation by Scotland Yard, which uncovered cryptocurrency wallets worth billions. The UK government is now battling to retain the seized funds.

For example, people like Eric Trump have a noticeable following at these events, and the conversation often seems to revolve around speculation rather than the foundational principles of decentralizing finance, increasing economic fairness, or building open systems.

I’m curious if others are seeing the same trend.

2025-11-13 10:20:05,coinfeeds-bot,comment,"ETH News: Ethereum Whale Accumulates $105M in ETH, $1.33B Since Early November",ETH,"tldr; An Ethereum whale has accumulated 30,548 ETH worth $105M, contributing to a total of $1.33B in ETH purchases since early November 2025. This activity reflects strong investor confidence despite market volatility. The whale reportedly used a $270M loan from Aave for the purchases, indicating a leveraged strategy. Experts suggest such accumulation tightens market liquidity, potentially stabilizing prices. Ethereum is currently trading above $3,500, with potential for recovery towards $4,000 if bullish momentum continues and institutional activity increases.

2025-11-12 19:17:59,CriticalCobraz,comment,Ethereum whales have accumulated over $350 million in ETH during the recent market pullback,ETH,"**Summary:**

Ethereum whales have accumulated over $350 million in ETH during the recent market pullback, suggesting institutional investors are buying at discounted prices in anticipation of a potential rebound. Major purchases include a newly created wallet acquiring 10,000 ETH ($34 million) and another whale buying 58,811 AaveETH ($206 million). Analysts note that the OTC nature of these trades points to institutional activity rather than retail participation. While the broader crypto market remains subdued due to macroeconomic uncertainty, large investors are accumulating Ethereum, potentially signaling a trend reversal. Ethereum has recovered around 10% from its recent low and is currently trading at $3,533, with a 69% chance of reaching $4,000 according to prediction markets.",0.2263

BlackRock is expanding its global Bitcoin strategy by launching the iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), expected to debut in mid-November 2025. This ETF will provide Australian investors with regulated exposure to Bitcoin through a traditional exchange, eliminating the need for offshore accounts or direct crypto custody. The fund will carry a 0.39% management fee and track the U.S.-listed iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT). This move aligns Australia with major jurisdictions like the U.S., Germany, and Switzerland, reflecting growing institutional demand for Bitcoin in the Asia-Pacific region. The launch follows updated regulatory guidance from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, requiring crypto-related services to obtain an Australian Financial Services Licence by 2026.",0.8651

One quote that really stood out to me:

""The idea of returning to gold-backed money sounds comforting, like getting back together with a reliable ex. But you’d be forgetting the reasons you split up. Yes, fiat is a toxic relationship, but that doesn’t mean gold is the answer. What we need isn’t a reunion. We need an upgrade.""

[Bitcoin vs Gold – Part 1](https://cryptoconfidence.substack.com/p/commodity-money-vs-bitcoin-part-1)

[Bitcoin vs Gold – Part 2](https://cryptoconfidence.substack.com/p/gold-vs-bitcoin-part-2)

It frames Bitcoin as more than just a digital asset,  there’s context, history, and comparisons to gold that actually make you think.

Curious to hear your thoughts:

Do you see Bitcoin as a better store of value than gold?

Or is gold still the “reliable ex” we can’t quit? 

Did anything in these articles shift how you think about crypto at all?

Feels like there’s so much noise online, and this is one of the few things that actually breaks it down for beginners. Would love to hear other perspectives!",0.9843
2025-11-14 17:29:18,soarky325,comment,Bitcoin or Gold? This actually made me think,BTC,"I think that both metals and bitcoin will play a role in whatever ecosystem ends up developing in our monetary future.

Simply put, most normal people will be buying bitcoin on exchanges and, as such, their transactions will be visible on the network and their wallets will be known by the powers that be. Future users of bitcoin will not be able to transact privately using bitcoin but will gain the other advantages that it offers. 

Meanwhile, gold and silver will be used for transacting in privacy as physical metals cannot be reliably traced. You may not be able to send gold across the planet via a blockchain but your metal transactions aren't documented for all to see.

In my opinion, they'll both continue to be used and will serve entirely different purposes.",0.8608

If your government goes full rogue and starts to cancel the currency and ban cryptos, gold is still usable on the black market without any traces.

There is no potential undiscovered flaw in the algorithm of gold since it has none.

Nothing to be feared of a working quantum computer if you own gold.

On the other hand it's difficult to store and a bitch to travel with.

2025-11-11 17:10:06,coinfeeds-bot,comment,Altcoin season unlikely before Bitcoin’s new ATH: Wintermute,BTC,"tldr; Wintermute analyst Jasper De Maere suggests that a broader altcoin rally is unlikely until Bitcoin reaches a new all-time high (ATH). Bitcoin is currently trading in the $105,000 to $107,000 range, about 16% below its ATH, showing signs of resilience and potential for a new rally. Altcoin performance has been uneven, with gains varying across sectors. Despite a stabilization phase in the crypto market, sentiment remains cautious, and altcoins are unlikely to see significant upward momentum without Bitcoin's surge.

A soft fork proposal, BIP-444, suggests banning non-monetary data for a year to address these concerns. The debate has divided the community, with accusations of censorship and threats to Bitcoin's neutrality and financial freedom.

2025-11-11 11:55:09,Pineapple-crypto,post,Pineapple x MotionDEV: decentralizing healthcare | win $250 worth of MDEV,ETH,"Hey r/CryptoCurrency! Ali Abood from Pineapple back again.

Last time we stopped by we introduced Pineapple Express: our community-driven incubator built to identify, back, and launch the most promising projects in crypto and beyond.

Today we’re excited to share the first one launching within the Pineapple umbrella: a Harvard-backed human-performance protocol building tech that connects real human performance with Web3. Their infrastructure is built to power decentralized health and DeSci applications that use verified real-world human data for research, innovation, and new on-chain experiences.

Joining me is Florin Otto (u/motiondevv), CEO of MotionDEV and former co-founder of Human.ai (ATH FDV $1.7B), who’s now leading the charge on bringing DeSci into mainstream consumer tech through Pineapple.

Happy to go deep on:

• How Pineapple Express identifies, backs, and launches ecosystem projects

• How motion and performance data are verified on-chain

• Use cases for athletes, developers, and health researchers

• Token design, ecosystem incentives, and long-term sustainability

• How MotionDEV slots into the Pineapple ecosystem and where it scales next

• Infrastructure, data models, hardware, adoption - and the roadmap from her

• How developers and researchers can build on top of verified motion data
How you can burn PAPPLE to receive MDEV 

Ask us anything - we’re looking forward to an open discussion! Whether you’re into sports performance, tech, data ownership, or DeSci, we’d love to hear your perspective.

✅ We’ll be heading back here on 12th November at 8pm UTC to answer your questions.

✅ We’ll check back in at the same time on 13th November to follow up with any replies.

✅ We’ll pick the 5 best answers to win a share of $250 worth of $MDEV tokens.

On one hand, I can imagine blockchain being helpful in ensuring insurance, medical notes and client information to have greater security and to help stamp out fraudulent alterations taking place, but on the other hand, ensuring confidential information remains truly confidential is another challenge.

Data shows Bitcoin has ended six of the past eight Decembers in the green, with gains ranging from 8% to 46%. Analysts suggest factors like strategic accumulation by long-term holders, anticipated Fed rate cuts, and institutional adoption could bolster this rally. Additionally, proposed liquidity measures, such as a $2,000 tariff dividend, may further support risk assets like Bitcoin.

Welcome to the CCMOON DAO update marking the start of Moon Week 68. This update highlights significant financial growth, key integrations, new sponsorships, and upcoming governance proposals that will shape the next phase of the DAO’s development.

The DAO continues to progress toward formal legal registration through MIDAO, expanding partnerships, and strengthening DeFi use cases for Moons. In the weeks since the last update, we have seen strong revenue inflows, expanded liquidity positions, and new integrations that continue to bring real utility and value to the ecosystem.

# 1. General Overview and Useful Links

Moons on Arbitrum One are now being used more actively than ever before. With lending, trading, and DAO-owned liquidity positions all growing, Arbitrum One has become the center of onchain activity for Moon holders. Nearly half of all non-burned Moons are now productive in DeFi pools or DAO-managed liquidity, showing that the ecosystem is thriving with engaged users, integrations, and real usage.

# 2. Treasury Overview

As of November 9, 2025, the DAO Treasury holds approximately $12,168 in non-Moon assets and 823,192 Moons.

Moons decreased by 25,000, representing a transfer to the Community Currency App Bot to refill rewards for outstanding distributions. ETH remains unchanged in quantity but decreased in fiat value due to price movement. The DAO’s stablecoin holdings increased significantly as more sponsorship payments were received.

Treasury Holdings:

|Asset|Balance|Value (USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Moons|823,192|$52,157|
|ETH|0.83683|$2,998|
|USDC|6,826|$6,826|
|USDT|1,301|$1,301|
|ARB|1,848|$556|
|USDC.E (bridged)|487|$487|

Non-Moon value: $12,168  
Change since last update: +$3,417  
Stablecoin value (USDC, USDT, USDC.E): $8,614  
Change in stablecoins since last update: +$3,489

# 3. Burn Summary

Arbitrum One: 1,038,094 Moons burned  
Arbitrum Nova: 3,189,800 Moons burned  
Total burned: 4,227,894 Moons

Since the October 30 update:  
• Arbitrum Nova increased by 57,546 Moons (largely from Kraken’s burn event)  
• Arbitrum One increased by 117 Moons  
• Combined total increase: 57,663 Moons burned

These burns highlight continued advertiser demand and the positive impact of large-scale partner events on Moon supply reduction.

# 4. DAO-Owned Liquidity (DOL)

The DAO now operates two Uniswap liquidity positions to improve balance and fee efficiency.

First position (original pool, 0.05% fee tier):  
• Composition: 67,654 Moons and 960 USDC  
• Value: $5,455  
• Total fees earned since last update: $134.37  
• Breakdown: 1,081 Moons and 62.53 USDC collected  
• These fees will be redeployed into liquidity after collection

Second position (new pool, 0.3% fee tier):  
• Composition: 2,379 Moons and 126.02 USDC  
• Value: $284.08  
• Fees earned: $0.74

Combined DAO-owned liquidity value: $5,739.08  
Change since last update: +$1,948

These two positions give the DAO flexibility to capture more trading volume during price swings and maintain deeper market presence without needing to sell Moons for rebalancing.

# 5. Distribution Updates

Polygon Labs has contributed $5,000 in POL tokens to the DAO, equivalent to 25,000 POL for distribution to subreddit users.

For Moon Week 68, the DAO will distribute 6,820 Moons, reflecting cumulative revenue-based allocation since Epochs 67 and 68.

The Community Currency App is now fully back online. Redundancies have been added to ensure users can always claim their rewards in the event of future outages.

Since the last update on October 29, the DAO received $8,284 in new revenue from Kraken, Monad, [Rails.xyz](http://Rails.xyz), Quickswap, and ETH Strategy. Kraken’s payment was a pure burn, so the DAO will make up the equivalent amount by allocating future revenues to the Distribution, Treasury, and DAO-Owned Liquidity pools before resuming additional burns.

# 6. Governance and Upcoming Proposals

Two major proposals will go live this Moon Week:

1. Formalizing CCMOON DAO as a legal Marshall Islands non-profit DAO LLC through MIDAO.
2. Authorizing DAO officers to negotiate advertising partnerships with protocols, projects, or personalities that add utility and visibility to Moons.

These votes mark key next steps for formal structure and operational autonomy within the DAO.

# 7. Teller Integration and Moon Utility

Moons are officially live on Teller, and users can now use their Moons as collateral to borrow USDC or deposit them to earn yield. Teller held an AMA on the subreddit to guide users through the process.

This integration provides another major use case for Moons in DeFi. Teller’s initial incentive pool is paying a high APY for Moon deposits, funded directly by their treasury, though rewards will decrease over time as total deposits grow.

# 8. Future Plans

The DAO’s top priority remains completing legal registration with MIDAO as a Marshall Islands DAO LLC. This will formalize structure, provide legal protection, and enable direct contracting with partners.

Other active initiatives include:  
• Continuing DeFi integrations like Teller and Uniswap liquidity expansion  
• Pursuing grants to support DEX integrations on [ccmoons.com](http://ccmoons.com)  
• Building faster bridge solutions between Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One  
• Hosting recurring AMAs and live DAO updates across platforms to expand beyond Reddit

That concludes the CCMOON DAO update for November 9, 2025. The next update will provide results from the Moon Week 68 governance votes, updated revenue totals, and any additional partnership or liquidity developments.",0.9986

**Only Moons held in self-hosted wallets at the time of poll creation will be eligible to vote**, so if you are holding Moons on an exchange, the telegram TipBot or in a wallet that you are not comfortable connecting to snapshot then please be sure to transfer your Moons to a self-hosted wallet that you are comfortable connecting to snapshot before each Moon Week. 

For more information about governance polls, please [see the Moons Wiki here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki/#wiki_governance).

The U.S. claims it was a legal seizure tied to Chen Zhi, owner of Prince Group, who was indicted for wire fraud and money laundering. The Bitcoin, allegedly linked to LuBian, a major cryptocurrency miner, remained dormant until 2024. Beijing suggests the operation was state-orchestrated, while the U.S. asserts Zhi owned the wallet. The case highlights complexities in international cryptocurrency crime and jurisdiction.

China's just thinking of the common man. they totally had no connection to this whatsoever and totally aren't doing this because they want their coins back. 

It's just pure altruism from the worlds largest human rights oriented group in the world. Nothing to see here.

The move sets the pace as the first of several national banks planning similar moves in the coming months.

SoFi previously gave customers the ability to buy, sell, and hold crypto through its app, but it agreed to shutter that service two years ago to obtain [approval](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2022/nr-occ-2022-4.html#:~:text=The%20conditions%20imposed%20on%20the%20bank%20include:,*%20Provide%20fair%20treatment%20to%20its%20customers) for its national banking license.

Starting Tuesday, select retail customers can again trade bitcoin ([BTC-USD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/)), ether ([ETH-USD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD/)), and other crypto assets. The plan is for all of SoFi's 12.6 million customers to gain access before the end of 2025.

“Today marks a pivotal moment when banking meets crypto in one app,"" SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a press release statement. ""It’s critical to give our members a secure and regulated way to step into the future of money,"" Noto added.

Biden-era regulators largely discouraged banks from delving into crypto, but US bank regulators [have swiftly reversed that stance during President Trump's first year in office](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sofi-rolls-out-crypto-trading-for-retail-customers-130019758.html).",0.8537

Previously halted to secure a banking license, SoFi now allows select customers to trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, with plans to expand access to all 12.6 million customers by 2025. CEO Anthony Noto emphasized the importance of secure and regulated crypto integration. Other major banks are expected to follow suit, signaling broader adoption of crypto services in traditional banking.

2025-11-11 01:25:19,Negative_Top_4216,post,Jasmy and Janction relationship!,ETH,"Someone tell me if AI got this explanation correct below:

How Jasmy and Janction (JCT) Work Together, Like a Story for a 5-Year-Old
Imagine you have a super-secret toy box called Jasmy. It's like a magic safe where you hide your favorite drawings, photos, or stories about your day (that's your ""data"" from toys like phones or cars). Only you decide who gets to peek inside, and if you share, you can even get stickers (rewards) for being brave. Everyone loves playing in the big playground built around this safe box because it's fair and no one steals your stuff.

Now, picture Janction (JCT) as a cool robot-building workshop right next to the playground. It's a special room full of fast computers (called GPUs, like super brains) where kids team up to make smart robots that draw pictures, tell jokes, or help with homework (that's ""AI"" magic). But to build the best robots, the workshop needs trusted toys from the safe box—without them, the robots might use fake or yucky stories.

How they team up like best friends: The workshop (Janction) asks the safe box (Jasmy) for safe, real toys to make its robots smarter and more fun. In return, the workshop says ""thank you"" by giving extra stickers from the Jasmy box to kids who help run the computers or play in the workshop (that's JCT holders getting free Jasmy stickers as surprises, called airdrops). The workshop buys these stickers from the toy store (open market) so everyone wins—no taking from the box directly. This makes the Jasmy stickers super popular because more kids want them to join the fun, and the workshop gets a strong, safe playground to build on.

How they help each other grow: Jasmy's safe box gets way more kids visiting the whole playground because the robot workshop is so exciting—it pulls in new friends who bring their own toys. Janction's workshop shines brighter with Jasmy's trust magic, so more kids trust it to rent computer time or vote on new robot ideas. Together, they make a bigger, happier playground where sharing feels safe and rewarding.

Their Roles in Different Use Cases (Real-World Jobs)
Jasmy's Role (The Safe Box Keeper): It's the boss of keeping your personal stuff private and useful. Think everyday fun like:
Your smartwatch or car sharing your steps or drives safely, so companies pay you tiny bits of money (rewards) without spying.
Apps where you control your photos or videos, earning stickers for letting AI use them to make cool filters or stories.
Big companies (like Panasonic) using it to store ""verified data"" so everything's honest—no fakes.

Janction's Role (The Robot Workshop Builder): It's all about sharing computer power for brainy tasks. Perfect for:
Renting out your home computer (GPU) to help train smart chatbots or draw art, earning money like $2,400 a month for top helpers.
Teams voting (governance) on how to make the workshop better, like adding more computers or fair rules.
AI jobs like video editing or science experiments that need fast brains, paid with JCT coins or credits.

Jasmy handles the ""safe sharing"" part (data privacy in IoT gadgets), while Janction adds the ""smart building"" part (AI computing on top). They fit together: Jasmy's safe data feeds Janction's robots, and Janction's growth buys more Jasmy to keep the circle going.


I think this explaination can quell confusion amongst Jasmy holders. Janction a layer 2 is built upon the JASMY ecosystem not vice versa.   Remember Jasmy PDLs store data from Janction and Janction also accesses  the PDLs on behalf of users ( mostly small to medium enterprises ) for various purposes related to Ai ,compute etc. 

Feel free to share your opinion. ",0.9998
2025-11-11 02:17:33,marcok36,comment,Jasmy and Janction relationship!,ETH,Interesting. So in the end Jasmy should continue to gain value.,0.8176
2025-11-12 15:06:32,whatwilly0ubuild,comment,Jasmy and Janction relationship!,ETH,"The metaphor is cute but glosses over critical technical and economic questions. The explanation doesn't clarify how the actual integration works or whether the value flows make sense.

For the technical relationship, if Janction accesses Jasmy PDLs (Personal Data Lockers) for AI training, there needs to be clear data licensing, consent mechanisms, and compensation flows. The explanation says Janction ""asks for safe toys"" but doesn't explain the actual API integration, data schemas, or access controls.

The tokenomics claim that Janction buys Jasmy from open market to airdrop to JCT holders sounds like circular value creation. Why would Janction spend treasury on another token instead of just rewarding with JCT? This usually indicates weak token utility for one or both assets. Our clients analyzing crypto projects see these cross-token reward schemes as red flags because they artificially inflate demand without organic use cases.

The Layer 2 claim needs verification. Is Janction actually a Layer 2 scaling solution built on Jasmy's blockchain, or is it just an application that uses Jasmy's data infrastructure? Those are completely different architectures. Most ""Layer 2"" marketing in crypto is inaccurate.

For the use cases, Jasmy controlling IoT data and Janction providing GPU compute are separate value propositions. The explanation assumes they're complementary but doesn't prove it. AI training needs large datasets but not necessarily IoT sensor data from smartwatches. The connection feels forced.

The ""$2,400 a month for top helpers"" GPU rental claim needs context. Is that gross revenue or profit after electricity costs? How many GPUs does that require? Most GPU sharing networks have way lower actual payouts after expenses.

If you're holding Jasmy and trying to understand the Janction relationship, dig into the actual technical documentation, not metaphorical explanations. Look for specifics about API integrations, data flows, token economics, and whether there's real product-market fit or just partnership announcements.",0.9907
2025-11-12 10:33:39,Negative_Top_4216,comment,Jasmy and Janction relationship!,ETH,"Furthermore Grok Said:

""Janction, as a Layer-2 blockchain incubated within the Jasmy ecosystem, leverages **JASMY** as its native gas token. This design choice ensures seamless integration with the Jasmy L1, where JASMY powers all transactions, executions, and operations on Janction—such as GPU rentals, AI workloads, and smart contract interactions. By requiring JASMY for gas fees, Janction creates ongoing demand for the token, as the L2 protocol acquires and burns JASMY to facilitate these activities, fostering a symbiotic economic loop between the layers without introducing a separate gas mechanism.

This setup differentiates JASMY (the foundational utility and settlement token) from JCT (Janction's complementary utility token for governance, staking, and DePIN-specific incentives). It aligns with Janction's Ethereum-compatible rollup architecture, which settles batches on the Jasmy Chain while optimizing for high-throughput AI and IoT applications.""

Hope this helps clears up any confusion on the roles of each token. Now we have to have patience to see how this materializes.",0.9118
2025-11-12 11:29:15,Negative_Top_4216,comment,Jasmy and Janction relationship!,ETH,"Estimated JASMY Burn Within a Year


Janction/Jasmy Chain incorporates a burn mechanism for gas fees, inspired by EIP-1559 (base fee burned, priority fee to validators/sequencer). This permanently removes a portion of used JASMY from circulation with each transaction, reducing supply and supporting long-term value accrual. Not all fees are burned (e.g., some go to node operators), but the model ensures deflationary pressure as adoption grows.
No official figure from Jasmy or Janction exists yet (as the mainnet launched in July 2025 and is still ramping up), but community and analyst projections provide context:

Projected Annual Burn Rate: 5–10% of total supply (50 billion JASMY), contingent on on-chain adoption scaling to 100,000+ daily active users and AI/GPU workloads.2e9912 This equates to 2.5–5 billion JASMY burned in the next 12 months (~$24–48 million USD at current prices).
Basis for Estimate:

Current low adoption: ~71,000 holders and modest transaction volume (~10,000–50,000 tx/day early post-launch).2e6a40
Growth Assumptions: If Janction hits 1 million daily tx (feasible for AI/DePIN L2s like Render or Akash), with ~1.5 JASMY average fee and 50–70% burn rate, daily burns could reach ~750,000 JASMY, annualizing to ~270 million—scaling to the 5–10% projection with ecosystem expansion (e.g., more dApps, IoT integrations).

Risks/Dependencies: Actual burns depend on usage velocity. Low adoption could limit it to <1% (500 million JASMY), while viral AI tools could exceed 10%. Past Jasmy burns (e.g., 700 million one-time in 2024) were manual; this is utility-driven and ongoing.

As Janction matures, monitor on-chain metrics via explorers like Arbiscan (for Orbit chains) for real-time burn data. This positions JASMY as a core utility asset in a growing DePIN-AI ecosystem.",0.9437

Bitcoin behaves as a 'digital savings asset,' with low turnover and more coins held long-term. In contrast, Ethereum functions as 'digital oil,' actively used for smart contracts, decentralized applications, and as network fuel. Ethereum's utility-driven behavior leads to higher coin movement, with long-term holders mobilizing coins three times faster than Bitcoin holders. Despite this, a significant portion of ETH is locked in staking and ETFs.

2025-11-12 18:31:54,0xpolygonlabs,post,"The world’s largest funds networkchooses Polygon to launch tokenized fund share classes to 4,500 financial institutions",ETH,"tl;dr

* Calastone, with £250B+ monthly, will launch tokenized fund share classes on Polygon
* Integration brings onchain fund distribution to 4.5k financial institutions in 58 markets
* Polygon’s sub-cent fees and near-instant finality make large-scale institutional settlement practical onchain
* Calastone is a major step toward bringing onchain capital markets built on scalable, transparent infrastructure

Calastone, the global funds network that processes more than £250 billion in transactions each month, is launching its tokenized fund distribution solution on Polygon, the go-to stack powering global money movement, supporting sending billions in value, instantly. 

The integration brings institutional-scale fund distribution onchain, enabling asset managers to operate fund share classes directly over blockchain rails while maintaining the administrative and compliance processes they already use. 

This marks one of the first large-scale integrations of blockchain into global fund infrastructure. Calastone’s adoption of Polygon provides a model for how tokenization can modernize asset distribution. With Polgyon’s rails, Calastone reduces intermediaries, expands cross-border access, and enhances transparency without disrupting compliance or custody standards.

Polygon delivers the scale, Ethereum compatibility, and cost efficiency that global institutions need to operate onchain, without sacrificing trust or performance.

By launching tokenized fund share classes on Polygon, Calastone unlocks new pathways for both institutional and retail investors. Asset managers can reach digital-first investor pools globally, while blockchain transparency and automation simplify settlement and reconciliation across jurisdictions.

The integration also signals a broader shift underway: the migration of traditional capital markets onto public, open infrastructure. As Polygon’s Rio and Heimdall upgrades bring speeds of up to 5,000 TPS and instant finality, the network continues to position itself as the go-to chain for institutional-grade payments and tokenized assets.

Calastone’s Tokenised Distribution is now live, with expanded functionality and network integrations planned throughout 2025, a milestone that takes a major step to bring the future of fund management onchain.",0.9678

BTC fees have been a major problem several times in the coin's history. These days it seems that BTC utilization is down, so fees remain fairly low. Miners need those fees to remain profitable as the block reward keeps halving. If price doesn't double by the next halving, some miners will be forced to go bankrupt. So keeping blocks full and transactions up is vital to keeping fees high. As of today, the average BTC fee is less than $1 per transaction, while miners' energy cost is surely more than that. Maybe this is why the Core devs are allowing larger amounts data in BTC transactions via Taproot and removing OP\_RETURN limits, as they'll fill up the blocks and increase fees artificially?

Average fees went to $128.45 in 2024:

I called it out many times. I've yet to see this fee market work the way blockstream envisioned. Sure, they've gotten short term spikes, but in the long term, it trends down as btc price goes up. any spikes just results in people transacting off chain more and more (including lightning, but also cefi/exchanges), causing fees to trend back down.

fees always stay low, in the long term.

there's only one solution: rolling commit the utxo set hash to blocks, serve utxo set archives as the ibd, perma-prune ancient block data, and increase the block size to modern bandwidth capability (128mb, or 1 second at 1gbps. with an average of 10 minutes you could potentially multiply 128 by 60 seconds, and it'll still be safe).

I don't know why we store every block in existence. its like storing the individual packets you downloaded separately to the file you were downloading. The only data that matters is the utxo set that tracks who owns what. The argument that bigger blocks cause centralisation needs reviewing in 2025 - it's large ibd that causes centralisation, therefore disk space is the issue, not bandwidth. if we can consider hashing the security technique that validates our transactions, it makes sense hashing the utxo set offers the exact same security.

>yet to see this fee market work the way blockstream envisioned

Fee market is a nonsense terminology. It's like a ""parking ticket market"", people don't compete to pay fees. The reason fees went down is people moved to coins other than BTC for payments (economic theory behind this is ""substitute goods"").

It manages a Treasury-heavy balance sheet with $181.2 billion in reserves, generating over $10 billion in profit in 2025 due to high interest rates. Tether mints and redeems USDT, manages reserves in Treasurys, and uses policy-like tools such as freezing wallets and shifting blockchain support. However, it lacks a public mandate, sovereign backstop, and full financial audits, distinguishing it from traditional central banks.

BTC - Looks exhausted, only a moron would sell this this after a large fall from 124000, bears take profits too. Oversold on RSI and Stochastics. Bullish divergence on the daily chart. There is a strong double strength support at 91000 and change. Extremely bearish sentiment based on nothing, there is no monster under the bed. Verdict - Look for buys around 91000.

ETH - Chart is suggesting we have one final leg down before we bounce back. Oversold on RSI and stochastics. Similar to BTC there is a strong double strength support on the weekly chart around 2700. Verdict - Buy for a strong bounce around 2700.

The fear and greed index is currently showing a reading of 10 according to TradingView. Insane bounce territory, particularly when the fall has been quick. The quicker the fall, usually the stronger the bounce.

Convergence across multiple metrics we have one final leg down before the big bounce. We all waited for prices to fall like this, now they're here, don't fumble the opportunity.

2025-11-14 16:29:24,Mecanik1337,post,What do you think about SaaS-based mining? I built OneClickMiner and would love general feedback,BTC,"Hi all,

I've been working on a project for the past couple of months called **OneClickMiner,** a *SaaS platform that lets people rent small amounts of hashrate for different mineable coins*.

Before anything else:

* **No referral links, no promo links, no rewards, no sign-ups attached.**
* This post is *not* financial advice, nor an attempt to sell anything.
* I'm not asking anyone to DM me or to join anything. I just want to share the concept and get community thoughts on the model itself.

**What it actually is:**

It's basically a way for people to experiment with mining without buying hardware. Users pick a coin, pick a small package (from tiny 3-hour ones to larger rentals), and the mining is done using rented rigs from external marketplaces. The platform itself doesn't hold any mined coins, payouts go directly from the pool to the user’s wallet.

**Why I built it:**

I noticed a lot of people are interested in mining but don't want to deal with:

* high hardware costs
* noise/heat
* electricity issues
* setup/config
* maintaining miners So I thought a simple “click, mine, done” interface could make the whole experience more accessible.

**How it works behind the scenes:**

* It sources hashrate from existing rig-rental networks
* Coins include BTC, LTC, DOGE, KAS, BCH, RVN, XMR, and others
* The goal is to make it cheap to try, some rentals are just a few dollars
* Results depend entirely on the network difficulty and luck (especially solo mining)
* The platform earns a small margin between rental cost and package price
* There's no token, no investment scheme, no staking, and no promises of returns

**Why I'm sharing this here:**

I know mining discussions here often split into:

* “DIY or nothing”
* “Cloud mining is a scam” So I'd genuinely like honest feedback about this *SaaS-rental* model. It's transparent, doesn't promise profit, and doesn't act as a custodian, but I'd love to hear how the wider community views this kind of platform.

**Do you see value in lowering the barrier to mining?**  
Or does the community prefer sticking to hardware-based setups?

Happy to answer *general* questions about the model.

2025-11-15 15:27:45,MaximumStudent1839,comment,Any real hint on recent surge of monero and zcash? No personal idea. Thanks,ETH,"From timing-wise, the ZEC pump coincided with its Tachyon upgrade.

Most of the market seems extremely confused on what is what. Some ZEC advocates are saying it is because of anticipating of “upcoming” ZEC halving - an event happened last year, rofl. Some are saying it is because of ZEC is seeing a surge of adoption  - very weird argument when you realize it processes fewer tx than the fading away Cosmos hub. Generally, most are just chasing strong PA, not knowing what is really going on.

Then there is a lot buzz about “community”. Well…. Most of these “community” only showed up their face in this upward PA move….

The gist of the Tachyon upgrade is scaling its ZK txs tps in the shielded pool.

But I have never seen the market pump a tech upgrade like this without the follow up metric to show real adoption. It is seems like a very weird outlier.

Then there is hype about its “Cypherpunk” DAT. But it has already brought its initial at a price way below current market cap. It needs 4x-5x more cash than its market cap to get its 5% target. Not sure how they will raise that.

Then there is just massive hype about “rich ppl” talking about it and supporting it. It seems like a very odd center of focus when the messaging is about “cypherpunk” ethos, rofl.

Edit: My conspiratorial theory is, they needed a medium-sized cap, they can afford to do serious supply control, but have enough fugazi narrative to convince the low-info public of a deserved rerating. Launch a DAT once you can confirm there is enough cabal/KOL/elite support to fund this rerating. Make the DAT buy at low enough prices before public announcement, but let the cabal/KOL/elite know about it to front-run it. Once you have enough mNAV gains, tell the public to push for the flywheel to draw more liquidity. ZEC seems like a good candidate. It aligned the CCP ASIC miners, Solana PnD groups, KoLs from different ecosystems, etc.

The question is what happens when ZEC tops, since there is no established buying base before it all.  Maybe the DAT can pivot to another low-cap to drive up mNAV growth. Not sure if it is a good idea because a DAT pivoting to add more assets would make buyers question ZEC's valuation. Once your main asset's price starts to unravel, it puts pressure on the DAT to sell assets instead of buying them.

Honestly, I am somewhat flabbergasted that this thing hasn't topped yet. My entire X feed is ZEC ZEC ZEC ZEC ZEC.... There is literally nothing else... At this point, there are no FOMO buyers left. They keep reminding everyone ZEC ZEC ZEC ZEC while they caballed the PA into crazy territory in a sea of red. Pretty sure if you succumbed to FOMO, then you would have brought it already.",0.9916

2025-11-11 04:52:32,aminok,post,Ethereum’s Trust Layer Expands Beyond the Blockchain,ETH,"A new demo called **compute-escrow-privy** shows what the next stage of Ethereum’s expansion might look like. Built on **EigenCompute**, part of the EigenLayer ecosystem, it connects an ordinary Web2 escrow service to Ethereum’s validator-backed trust model.

It’s a small project, but it represents something big: the extension of Ethereum’s security into the off-chain world.

The demo uses a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) backend and Privy authentication, letting users sign in through standard Web2 methods while the core logic settles verifiably on Ethereum. Developers can fork the repository, deploy it through the EigenX CLI, and run a service that looks like a normal web app but operates under the same type of trust guarantees that secure the Ethereum network.

What this shows is more than a technical trick. It is a working demonstration of a new design pattern for how trust itself can be built, reused, and extended.

# 1. Practical verifiability for Web2

Instead of launching new blockchains or validator networks, developers can now anchor traditional applications to Ethereum’s existing security. That makes it practical to build verifiable services — like escrows, marketplaces, or data processors — without needing to reinvent the infrastructure of decentralization from scratch.

# 2. ETH as a universal bond

In this model, **ETH becomes the reusable foundation of digital trust**. The same capital that secures Ethereum’s consensus can now back independent services, functioning as a kind of economic bond for integrity. Each new application strengthens the network’s relevance, because its trust ultimately flows from Ethereum’s validators and the collateral they restake.

# 3. Familiar experience, verifiable core

From the user’s perspective, nothing changes — logins, dashboards, and APIs all feel like the Web2 internet. But under the hood, execution happens in verifiable environments, and outcomes can be proven on-chain. This merges convenience with verifiability instead of forcing a choice between them.

# 4. Broader implications

If this pattern spreads, it could reshape how the internet handles trust.  
Developers might stop creating new chains for every new idea and instead **reuse Ethereum’s validator base** to secure services directly. A whole market could form around *renting* Ethereum’s trust, where validators, restakers, and developers price and trade cryptographic assurance itself.

It also means that the boundary between Web2 and Web3 could fade. The same Ethereum security that once applied only to smart contracts could start underpinning AI models, databases, and cloud apps, without users even realizing it.

# 5. A shift in Ethereum’s role

Rollups and data blobs scaled Ethereum’s capacity to process transactions. EigenLayer and applications like compute-escrow-privy scale something different: **its trust model**. Ethereum’s reach is no longer confined to blockchains — it’s becoming a **base layer for verifiable computation**.

Whether this model becomes a standard is uncertain, but its direction is clear. Ethereum’s trust is beginning to extend beyond its own chain, out into the rest of the internet.

After a cut in October, expectations are that the central bank will proceed cautiously. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has already indicated that further rate cuts are not guaranteed.

With official data lacking, analysts are now turning to figures from companies like ADP and Indeed to gauge the labor market. Meanwhile, the Cleveland Fed is trying to estimate inflation using its own model. According to that model, inflation likely stayed around 3 percent in October, similar to September. However, this remains an estimate and cannot replace official data.

Even if the government shutdown ends quickly, economists warn that the backlogs are significant. Inflation reports for October and November may arrive too late to influence the December rate decision. This means the Fed may have to make its decision without fresh data on the table.

Markets Hanging on Every Word

Investors are closely watching every word from Fed officials. Speeches from influential members, like John Williams of the New York Fed and Raphael Bostic of the Atlanta Fed, are being scrutinized.

Financial markets are still cautiously pricing in a potential rate cut in December, but that probability is fading. Without new data, the Fed may decide to play it safe and leave rates unchanged for now.

Central banks outside the U.S. are also monitoring developments closely. This week, new data and policy statements are expected from Canada, China, the U.K., Japan, and Sweden. But in the U.S., it remains quiet.

The shutdown is not only halting data releases but also making data collection impossible. Even if Washington reopens, economists expect delays and incomplete reports.

2025-11-10 14:56:04,crowdl,post,Recurring Bitcoin purchase on Kraken Pro?,BTC,"Hi everyone,

I'd like to setup a recurring Bitcoin purchase (ie. daily automatic purchase). I haven't found the option to do so on the Kraken Pro app. I did find it on normal Kraken app, but it charges a fee of around 1% per purchase, which I believe is too high.

Is there any way to setup a recurring purchase without fees or with lower ones? Is this possible with Kraken or I should use another exchange / app?

Note: It's a business account (created for a LLC), not a personal one.

Thanks in advance.",0.4922

2025-11-13 18:19:36,hodorrny,post,2026 401k limits just increased could this affect crypto market liquidity,BTC,"the irs just bumped 401k limits to 24,500 for 2026 up from 23,500 in 2025. ira limit moves to 7,500. for catch ups, age 50 plus can add 8,000 and the special age 60 to 63 catch up stays 11,250. looks small, but across millions of savers it is real money shifting into tax advantaged accounts.

why it matters for crypto… more room in 401ks could mean a little less cash chasing risk assets outside retirement. also, a heads up for higher earners: starting in 2026, catch ups are roth only if your prior year social security wages with that employer were 150k or more, so the tax break on the catch up isn’t the same as pre tax.

counterpoint… a small but growing set of plans now allow crypto exposure directly or via brokerage windows and bitcoin etfs, so higher limits could funnel some money into btc or eth inside retirement menus. that said, usage is still limited.

and zoom out… only about 14 percent of participants max out their 401k anyway, so the macro impact may be modest versus headlines.

what do you think, does this pull liquidity from spot crypto or is the overlap too small to move the needle",0.8672

2025-10-31 21:39:48,hodorrny,post,Trump Isn’t “Pro Crypto”... He’s Pro Trump...and his gang,BTC,"i know u people have probably heard it before but it is way clearer now than it was a year ago. A lot of what looks like “Trump loves crypto” lines up almost perfectly with stuff that benefits him... his family... or people close to him... not the average person holding BTC on a phone.

First... the public moves. He has been saying the U S should “support” digital assets... he has framed it as ending the old “war on crypto”... and he has tried to make it sound like America is open for on chain business again. All very loud... very pro innovation.

At the same time... reports this year said the Trump family’s own crypto and token ventures have pulled in hundreds of millions of dollars... in the same window when the administration was sounding the most crypto friendly. That overlap is hard to ignore. It looks less like “pro crypto” and more like “we made it friendlier while we were selling.”

Then there was the CZ pardon. Call it mercy if you want... but it was clearly a made-for-one-person decision. In the months leading up to it... Binance and CZ brought on Trump-aligned lobbyists... hired a D.C. firm close to his circle and spent serious money... and looped in a former SEC-adjacent lawyer who already had credibility with the new team. Several reports said the clemency push went through political channels... not the usual DOJ path. So this wasn’t “the administration helped crypto”... it was “a well connected crypto billionaire bought his way to the front of the line.”

Now add the tariff noise. Every time he rattles trade partners... Canada... Europe... whoever... it makes legacy markets nervous and pushes some attention back toward crypto... while his circle is the group most ready to sell... raise... and market in that environment. Convenient timing.

One more angle most people miss. The more this stuff turns into “policy for friends,” the messier your own taxes get because now you’re mixing airdrops, political tokens, pardoned-exec pump candles, prediction style gains etc. I’ve started tracking those flows separately in Awaken tax instead of just throwing it all under “capital gains,” because if the rules keep getting written by insiders I do not trust the IRS to be chill about how I label income later. That part is self defense not shill.

So yeah... he is not “pro crypto” the way CT means it. He is pro... his... crypto. Pro... his donors’... crypto. Pro... his friends’... crypto. Everyone else still has to buy tops and read press releases.",0.9958

days later: he confirmed a meeting with xi and said the 100% tariff idea was “not sustainable,” effectively softening the policy stance that helped trigger the sell off.

meanwhile: the Financial Times reports the trump family has made roughly $1 billion in pre-tax profits from crypto ventures since the election. that reporting is the basis for the conflict of interest concerns.

the timing looks sus. whatis going on here?

political theater? scare china with a hard line, negotiate back. tariffs become leverage, not the end goal. traders get collateral damage. normal trade negotiation stuff.

policy testing? drop a shock to see market reaction, then calibrate strategy based on fallout. messy but plausible.

conflict of interest? if the family had holdings exposed, a crash and subsequent policy pivot could create trading opportunities. the optics are bad... and that alone justifies independent scrutiny and disclosure.

genuine error? trump makes a bad call, sees chaos, steps back.

regardless of intent, markets hate unpredictability. real people lost real money. a president whose family profits from the industry he regulates raises serious conflict of interest questions.

watch for : asset disclosures tied to policy moves. on-chain data for large wallet trades. congressional pressure for answers. if you were liquidated or sold during the panic, you're likely sitting on taxable events even if you lost money overall. capital losses can offset gains, but only if you report them correctly. given the volatility and political manipulation at play, accurate tax reporting matters more than ever (tools like awaken can help sort through the chaos of liquidations and trades during wild market swings).",-0.9877

I heavily invested into an alt coin (my posts history makes clear which) a few years ago with the typical belief that it was solving a real world problem and would continue development, making a healthy ROI. I was so very wrong. It's become apparent that the tokenomics have been completely manipulated and supply diluted, and all previous correspondence from the team deleted to cover their tracks. They're actively minting and dumping tokens as I write this.

I know I should have diversified my portfolio more. I know I shouldn't have trusted an alt coin. I know I shouldn't have invested more than I was willing to lose. I started my crypto journey in a pretty desperate position, that's why I took on elevated risk. But my situation has only become so much worse and I feel embarrassed and ashamed. It is no ones fault but mine for me choosing to invest, but I didn't expect to be fighting against a malicious, scamming team.

To be honest, I don't even know why I'm posting this here because I think people will just give me hate and make me feel worse. But either way I've just fucking ruined my financial future and no one can help me. It's a really strange feeling to accept absolute failure and say it out loud (well, type it I suppose). 

Don't be like me. I thought I was desperate, but this is another level. Doesn't feel like there's much point carrying on here now when only a miracle could shift my course. Oh well.

2025-11-04 09:44:13,RandomJoe7,post,My takeaway from being in crypto for 8+ years.,BTC,"I've been in crypto for a while now, and here's my key takeaways (might be wrong, might be right... so take it with a grain of salt).

- It looks like the 4 year cycle is doing it's thing again, like usual.

- The tops come a bit sooner every time. Why? Because people like me think ""I don't want to hold the bag again, the top will be in November, so let me make sure to get out a bit earlier than everyone else this time"".

- The market overall is less explosive due to the obvious reasons that the crypto market cap has become much bigger than 5-10 years ago, so doing 100x is basically impossible (other than niche meme coin pump and dumps) and even 10x is way less likely. Going forward it will be even less X. The world market just isn't big enough for that kind of growth, and with institutional investors in BTC it will generally become more stable.

- Alts performing worse with every cycle (again, there's exceptions, I'm speaking overall). Why? Because the market and the people are maturing, almost everyone has had contact with crypto at this point, and for most of them it was negative (i.e. loss, scams, rug pulls, pump and dumps, NFTs, etc). There's not enough ""greater fools"" to keep the explosion going like 5-10 years ago when this was fresh.


Basically: the market is maturing, it's not the same as it was 5-10 years ago. Back then, we were all ""younger/more naive"", we thought crypto is some kind of technological revolution that will change the world, all trying to strike the next golden alt coin. Reality? It's not been that. It's a giant casino ridden with scams. It's pure gambling. I will probably never invest in an alt coin again, and I'm glad that the only ""alt"" coin I've invested in this cycle was ETH. But other than that, I will be sticking to only BTC going forward, as I can personally even see ETH dying off (albeit very slowly), as it has performed worse this cycle. Or maybe it'll be the ""silver"" to the ""BTC gold"", but that's about it.

With this realization, I've actually made money this cycle, as I sold everything recently with a good profit. I won't be holding the bags anymore like I did in previous cycles, sucking on the hopium/copium. :) Going forward, it will be BTC only, probably DCAing into it during bear market and then trying to ""sell early"" before the next top crashes again. And the more and more people have this realization for themselves, the worse Alts will perform in comparison to BTC going forward.",0.812

2025-11-04 10:30:01,chanmalichanheyhey,comment,My takeaway from being in crypto for 8+ years.,BTC,IMO it’s simple. There is just way too many coins and everyone is shilling different things liquidity gets thin,0.0
2025-11-04 11:08:05,skr_replicator,comment,My takeaway from being in crypto for 8+ years.,BTC,"It's far faster to do scams, then to mature the technological revolution, I still believe it's both, and the promised technological revolution is still taking its steps for realization. Just because we've seen those quick scams happen obviously first, doesn't mean that future is aborted. Nothing takes only 5 years to fully mature, especially not something that aim to overhaul the entire world economy. Credit cards also took decades to take hold, and crypto won't be any faster, despite it's being more techy, it's simply way too much of a bigger step to happen as quickly as something as small as fiat transitioning to credit cards. People just don't have patience anymore and want and expect everything to mature quickly, but that's simply not how anything will ever turn out.

Also with all these retail people selling earlier, it makes it feel even more like that the cycle is actually gonna be a bit longer this time, just like how the possibly delayed altseason (btc dominance always dropped before the crash started, every cycle, that has not yet happened at all so far this cycle), and the so far slowest bitcoin bullrun slope in its history is suggesting. Also, the fear and geed index is literally in extreme fear right now, that's not something you see at the top of the bullmarket, and just further hints that all the retail is scared it's ending, and like always will probably get proven false. It might get one last pump, they will probably get greedy again, buy back in, and then we'll crash for real.

So basically i see these repeated 3 phases in each cycle:

1. Crash happens, bitcoin crashes less than alts, so it's dominance grows. Extreme Fear

2. Bitcoin starts pumping, alts stay down, btc dominance grows further. Fear and greed unstable.

3. Bitcoin is at the top as starts losing steam, alts pump, so btc dominance falls. Extreme Greed.

So far this cycle we have seen the phase 1 and 2, but not yet the final phase 3.",-0.9847

Additionally, rising liquidations in leveraged trades and declining assets in spot Bitcoin ETFs contributed to the downturn. Technical indicators, such as a potential death cross pattern, suggest further downside for Bitcoin's price.

2025-11-05 01:04:34,Vaginosis-Psychosis,post,Bitcoin is only up ~53% on the 4 year chart... or ~36% adjusted for inflation.,BTC,"As comes as no surprise, literally every single prediction by every influencer and thought leader in the Bitcoin community about this cycle has been completely wrong.

Bitcoin is only up \~53% on the 4 year chart... or \~36% adjusted for inflation.

In the same amount of time, the S&P 500 is up 47% and gold is up 111%.

This is easily the worst performing 4 year period in Bitocin's history. Really makes you wonder about the 4 year cycle and diminishing returns.

Is Bitcoin cooked?

At this rate, if we're lucky, we can expect \~$180-$200k top for the next halving cycle around late 2029, which I'm not eve sure Bitcoin will be able to outperform the SP500 or gold for that matter.

I have to admit, I'm seriously disappointed in Bitcoin's performance. Adoption still isn't happening. I've been a Bitociner for 4.5 years now and I still do not know anyone who owns any. I never hear people talking about it in public or social settings and the few times I've ever brought it up, I get kinda blank stares.

Not to mention, it's clear form on chain metrics that long term holders and OG's are selling. So much for HODL.

Not really sure what to make of it at this point. I think $126k was the top and even if it wasn't, anything less than $160k isn't even double the previous ATH after adjusting for inflation. Some people think we'll make it to $140k this cycle, but even if we did, that's nothing to brag about.

Is this what we're to expect for Bitcoin moving forward? 53% gains every 4 years? What a joke.",0.5371

2025-11-05 03:26:32,xcrunner2414,comment,Bitcoin is only up ~53% on the 4 year chart... or ~36% adjusted for inflation.,BTC,"You should put things into perspective by also plotting the cost of production over time. At the peaks of the 2017 and 2021 bull markets, Bitcoin was several times greater than the actual cost to produce 1 BTC. Those were truly market “bubbles”—at least, in the short- to medium-term. Today, the market price of 1 BTC is about $100k, and cost of production is also approximately $100k.

What I’m trying to explain is that, yes, the relative performance of this current bull market is significantly weaker than those of previous bull markets, it’s also kinda an apples vs oranges comparison. Those bull markets peaked in true bubble fashion, and it was only right for them to crash -70%. Those crashes were rational because they brought the price of the commodity back down to more reasonable levels. This time, however, Bitcoin is *not* extremely overvalued. So yes, it’s quite expected that the performance would seem quite weak when measuring *from* extreme overvaluation *to* fair valuation.",0.8172

2025-11-01 19:40:27,coinfeeds-bot,comment,Bitcoin suffers its first October monthly loss in seven years,BTC,"tldr; Bitcoin experienced its first October monthly loss in seven years, ending the month down 5%. The decline followed a record liquidation event triggered by President Trump's announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, which caused Bitcoin to drop from $126,000 to near $104,800. Market uncertainty, reduced risk appetite, and the Federal Reserve's resistance to further rate cuts contributed to the downturn. Despite the loss, Bitcoin remains up over 16% year-to-date.

The wallet transferred 150 BTC, worth $16.6 million, to another address. Initially worth $16,400 in 2011, the 4,000 BTC is now valued at over $442 million. This activity aligns with increased movement from dormant bitcoin wallets, including a Satoshi-era whale selling over 80,000 BTC in July.

2025-10-26 13:48:45,Gullible-Tale9114,post,what actually caused CZ's pardon? Turns out it was months of expensive lobbying.,ETH,"CZ served 4 months in prison last year for violating antimoney laundering laws. got out, then Trump pardoned him. But according to Politico’s reporting and public lobbying filings, that pardon didn’t just happen... binance and CZ spent serious money trying to make it happen.

In late september, binance hired Ches McDowell ...described in multiple reports as tied to Trump’s circle and close to Donald Trump Jr.... to lobby the White House and treasury. his firm, Checkmate Government Relations, disclosed $450k for roughly one month’s work on “financial services policy and executive relief” targeting the White House Office and Treasury Department. And that’s just one piece of it.

In March, Zhao also hired Teresa Goody Guillén... a crypto lawyer who had been reported as under consideration for SEC chair.... to lobby the White House for “executive relief.” Reports indicate her firm has received around $290,000 from Binance and Zhao in 2025.

overall, reports put binance’s 2025 lobbying around $860k so far. separately, the trumplinked World Liberty Financial venture launched this year and has clear Trump family connections, though there’s no public filing showing a formal Binance partnership. Coverage describes significant paper gains and fundraising around that venture, with estimates and amounts varying across outlets.

Rep. Maxine Waters called the pardon a favor for “crypto criminals,” arguing it came after months of lobbying and money flowing into Trumplinked crypto ventures. Trump defended the move by saying Zhao “was persecuted by the Biden administration” and that what he did “wasn’t a crime.”

But CZ pleaded guilty to violating U.S. antimoneylaundering laws and accepted a fourmonth sentence. What’s clear is this wasn’t some random act of mercy ..... it followed a concentrated, expensive lobbying push aimed at senior executivebranch offices using Trumpworldconnected lobbyists. They hired heavyweight lobbyists, spent serious money, and operated within Trumplinked crypto circles throughout 2025.

It’s a pretty stark reminder of how deep regulation and influence now run in crypto. The same compliance systems that failed at the top are the ones regular investors are expected to handle on their own  accurately, every tax season, with no lobbyist to clean up the mess later.

That’s why a lot of traders I know have started automating the boring side tracking trades using awaken, wallets, and tax exposure in real time  just to stay ahead of the gray areas. Because in this space, *not knowing* the rules costs you more than any lobbying bill ever could.

Whether that’s just how Washington works or something closer to corruption depends on your perspective. But the pardon undeniably arrived after a costly and highly targeted influence campaign.",0.8659

2025-10-26 21:07:30,FeralDoge,post,I built a website to track whales and insider/suspicious trades on Polymarket,ETH,"Hey everyone,

Recently, I got really interested in the idea that people might actually be trading on inside info on Polymarket.

Polymarket’s data is all public, it just isn’t easy to visualize or filter out all the sports bets and low-impact events. So I created [**Polywhaler**](https://www.polywhaler.com/): a website that tracks large whale trades and potentially suspicious activity across Polymarket in real time.

You can see:

* Every non-sports trade over $10k
* Which markets whales are suddenly piling into + trade impact on odds
* A calculated “insider score” (might suggest someone knows something)
* Add crypto wallets to your watchlist to track specific traders
* Discord alerts for live whale trades
* Crypto price prediction markets (experimental, but fun to track)

It’s still early and pretty barebones, but would love to hear feedback or feature ideas, especially from anyone who follows Polymarket or enjoys watching these new internet markets and how accurate they are on predicting events.

2025-10-19 11:31:19,hodorrny,post,Everyone panicked on October 10… but that’s just crypto being crypto.,BTC,"everyone freaked out but this is textbook bull market behavior. in every bull run you get 2 to 4 major pullbacks, usually around 30 to 45%. what we saw wasn’t even close to that.

so yeah, it hurts. but it’s not unexpected. it’s not the end of the bull run, it’s part of it.

here’s what actually happened with the tariff stuff

on october 10, trump announced a new 100% tariff on chinese goods. markets freaked out instantly. bitcoin dropped about 8% to roughly $104,782 on oct 10. global stocks and tech megacaps lost over $770 billion in value that day.
it triggered a broad sell off. traders rushed to de risk, and crypto saw huge liquidations… about $16 to $19 billion wiped out in the episode.

but this is the usual cycle. markets panic, then the fed steps in. if the sell-off continues, powell could cut rates to stabilize things. rate cuts mean more liquidity. liquidity pushes crypto back up.
if trade tensions ease or central banks step in with liquidity, markets typically recover. that is the dynamic traders are watching.

the pullback is kind of an opportunity tbh

when people panic sell, that’s usually when you want to buy. panic selling never works long term. if you believed in crypto at $110k, you should love it more at $104k. same asset, cheaper price.

i’ve been holding since 2017. i’ve seen much worse. the people who actually made money weren’t the ones who panic traded… they were the ones who held through the scary dips and kept buying.

here’s the macro math
bitcoin still moves with the global money supply. when liquidity expands, bitcoin rises. when it tightens, it drops. right now, governments can’t afford to tighten too hard without breaking something.
so eventually, more liquidity will come… and that’s when crypto climbs back.


the big picture stays bullish. short term pain, long term trend intact.

don’t use leverage. seriously. that’s how people get wiped. buy dips only with what you can afford to lose. if you panic sold or got liquidated, those are taxable events. capital losses from the dip can offset your gains from earlier in the year, but only if you report them properly. with all the volatility we've seen, tracking every trade manually is a nightmare. that's where tools like awaken.tax actually help… they pull your transaction history and calculate gains/losses automatically so you're not scrambling in april trying to remember what you sold at $104k versus $110k.

every dip feels like the end when you’re in it. then six months later, you regret not buying more.",-0.9875

Long story short wrapped stable coins were valued on Binance at current market value and not their underlying value. 

Those coins de-pegged from USD in a thin/next to non-existent market and broke, amongst other exchanges, Binance. This was a failing from Binance itself and the way that it valued wrapped stable coins.

Saylor emphasized that Bitcoin's volatility is expected and advised focusing on long-term performance. He also stated that MicroStrategy has no plans to sell its Bitcoin, even in the event of significant price drops. The company recently transferred Bitcoin holdings to a new custodian, which some misinterpreted as a sale.

Today, that revolution seems to have come full circle: Wall Street now holds the keys.

From BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs to JPMorgan’s decision to accept Bitcoin and Ether as collateral, the very institutions Bitcoin was meant to bypass have become its custodians, its biggest beneficiaries and champions... and perhaps its greatest test.

I’ve always wondered how Bitcoin was *actually* supposed to work according to Satoshi, and I’m sure I am not alone in this

So I asked Bitget’s GetAgent: *“Satoshi, was Bitcoin really meant to be a store of value or a currency for everyday use?”*

This shift highlights the evolution of revolutions, where resistance leads to absorption and transformation. While Bitcoin's institutional adoption marks progress, its core promise of self-custody and user sovereignty remains a cultural battle. The future of Bitcoin depends on societal choices and values shaping the next era of money and freedom.

Last year when BTC rallied, VET went from £0.01 to £0.06, which if the same thing happened, I’d recoup most of my investment. However I hardly see any backing or following behind VET anymore.

Almost every indicator I look for a healthy project is present with Vechain.  
Just to name a few.

\- Active, frequent community engagement on twitter(spaces), including Sunny who drops in sometimes. Anyone can ask questions as long as you keep it civil.  
\- Clear roadmap at the start of the year, keeping every deadline and delivering.  
\- You can tell from their github activity that they clearly increased the amount of developer working on the project.  
\- Vebetter DAO with ever increasing dApps. These dApps mostly using AI to fact check and there are many bad actors and there are dApps which let you earn actual money from just picking up your dog poop(which you should be doing anyway) and get rewards for it.  
There was a post where a user thanked the developers because this paid for their dog treatment.  
You can earn money from drying your cloths on the sun and not using a dryer. Taking photos of your reusable mug. There is many more what you may find fun but overall and what matters for many is money. Casually(!!) using the app can get you $$$ monthly, yes you saw that right.  
\- Veword wallet login for dApps that made by vechain. Kinda like how facebook, gmail login works but for dApps which streamlines and takes the pain out of login.  
\- DEX with liquidity that allows moderate swaps between coins.  
\- Credit card that supports B3TR(afaik its called Stella pay). Less step to spend your crypto.  
\- Credit card(s) that support VET/ VTHO. Revolute and more credit card will start support this chain after the 2025 Q4 Hayabusa update.  
\- Vechain going full decentralized by end of this year!!! Anyone can become a validator without KYC.  
\- Mentioned before, metamask support and every goodies that comes with having proper multichain DEX support. Metamask got a credit card too I believe.  
2020 finally said hi to Vechain, better late than never.

These are just the things I remember without thinking much about it.

Price wise vechain doing dogshit and I'm not too worried about it.  
It will be bad when every coin goes up but vechain a.k.a not rising with the tide. This never happened so far.  
It will be bad if vechain is only rising with the tide and not gaining momentum. This never happened either.  
Whenever the bull market for alt started, Vechain was pulling ahead of others.

Last bullrun Vechain went even lower than now. Bloodbath is a gentle word to describe how bad it was YET vechain ended up being top 15 on CMC after a crazy run.

Got so excited that I even took some money out of the credit line to invest into crypto. Wasn't fine paying it all back while watching everything crash for a whole year in 2022. 

Got more cautious and tried to time things, experimented with position sizes, types of crypto, different signals, etc. Nothing worked for consistent results. I thought I had figured something out when I made \~$27,000 profit in 2024 but when I saw that most of the altcoins I held kept going down in 2025 I realized I have no idea what I'm doing. Decided to sell most bags and when I saw that the resulting net was -108k CAD, I realized how much of a dumbass I have been. Nothing I've thought of or devised worked, I just lost a shit ton of my money and time.

The whole thing seems like a scam to me. The sheer amount of information, types of currencies, types of ""rewards"", number of exchanges, and just factors to consider is designed to confuse and distract. You lose track of what's what. Even with manually trying to track what is going where in spreadsheets, plotting and recording trades in Tradingview, using budgeting software to track which funds go into which account... none of that helped in the end. 

Looking back, the conclusion is that I should have only been buying BTC and ETH. Everything else went through unpredictable rollercoasters or crashed to the bottoms of hell. So at this point I am out I don't trust myself to make any decisions about individual investments anymore. Will just put any savings into index funds and forget about looking at charts until retirement.

1.) Bitcoin / ETH investment  and waiting because both follow the power law and bitcoin is very rare in comparison to the ridiculous amounts of available altcoins -> easy 500% and more gain

2.) Feel clever (because Bitcoin is too easy etc.), read about weird altcoins, road maps, their promises, hype (fake-)news and hype postings in their own subreddit and twitter/x bubbles, announcements about not existing cooperations with big players; easy losses, ""death by thousand cuts"" / ""death by thousand small time altcoin investments when they surge""

Traders had anticipated a more dovish stance, leading to a 'buy the rumor, sell the news' scenario. On-chain data showed increased exchange inflows and normalized funding rates, suggesting a potential rebound. Analysts noted key support levels between $109,600-$108,000 and resistance near $112,300-$116,000, with volatility expected to persist amid macroeconomic uncertainty.

2025-10-31 16:08:22,002_timmy,post,100 top crypto influencers enter trading competition - only 19 in profit,ETH,"Synthetix Exchange is currently running a trading competition among 100 top crypto influencers. Each influencer was given $50,000 to trade on the platform.

As of now:

* Only 19 of the 100 traders have a positive PnL (meaning their account balance is above $50,000).
* 7 participants have made no trades at all, placing them between ranks 20–26 by default.
* 32 traders have lost 99% or more of their starting balance, meaning their accounts now hold less than $500.

This is a perpetual futures DEX, meaning traders can go long or short. Since it's a perp-dex, their performance isn’t tied to simple market direction because they can profit whether prices go up (long) or down (short) if they predict correctly. Despite that flexibility, the majority are losing heavily.

It’s a reminder that most influencers don’t make their money through trading. Their income often comes from deal flow, sponsorships, or promoting the platforms they appear to be using successfully. Many are subsidized or incentivized to generate high volume, creating the illusion of skill or profitability.

If they do make money trading, it's frequently by buying small cap coins early and shilling it later. These small caps are rarely put on perp dexes so they don't have this advantage.

Events like this pull back the curtain. Even with a fair playing field and access to the same tools as everyone else, very few of the so-called “top traders” can actually trade profitably.

And its just that - gambling. Not investing. Just placing occasional one direction bets.   
It’s been exactly 7 days since the biggest crypto liquidation ever - $19 billion wiped in a few hours. Everyone was overleveraged on HP, Aster, other dexs. I guess if i was the biggest cex by volume, i would also use my own books to price assets instead of relaying on some 3rd party. Loss of speed is main concern, but history gave us different lesson.

Now the question is, was that *the flush* or just the beginning? After all, we're between 2 interest cut rates...

BTC dropped hard but still holding the range. Around 108k down to 106k is where things got ugly. If we drop under 100k, next stops are like 98–94k. I personally don’t see it staying below that long. Weekly close above 100k keeps us safe. Below = probably panic zone.

ETH actually looks stronger, still chilling around 3.8k. As long as it closes above that, range intact. Below that, 2.8k is next. SOL also holding like a champ around 84–89, even after four red days.

Everyone’s doomposting right now. Fear and greed Index is deep in *fear*, not extreme fear yet, but close. That’s usually when the best entries happen. I’m not saying ape in, but historically this is where smart money starts scaling in.

Also worth noting: the global liq index broke its downtrend back in March and is ranging sideways. That’s good. Liquidity drives everything. More liquidity → higher risk appetite → higher BTC

[blue is the global liq index](https://preview.redd.it/wvcz81g4byvf1.png?width=372&format=png&auto=webp&s=bde6cbd30a63695f00c61e4e8242a27122b19f1d)

Gold’s at ATH, institutions aren’t selling BTC, and Trump’s probably pushing rate cuts again. Feels like sentiment is way more bearish than fundamentals.

If BTC does sweep 95–98k, I think it’s a shakeout before another bounce. Not financial advice, just saying… these levels feel like fear is peaking.",0.8912

2025-10-28 14:54:59,hodorrny,post,I have seen a lot of “if you pay crypto taxes you’re a moron.” ok champ… let’s talk,SOL,"crypto isn’t untraceable. most networks are public ledgers and your wallet history lives there forever. the name might not be on the address, but one kyc deposit or withdrawal ties the real you to that trail. on-ramps do kyc, agencies use blockchain analytics, and once a single touchpoint is linked, a lot of the rest can be inferred.

why people still get caught is boring and simple. exchanges file reports and answer lawful requests. banks flag big cash outs. your on-chain life leaves loud breadcrumbs… nfts, staking rewards, bridge receipts, lp tokens, all of it. then the mismatch letters show up because you sold on exchange a, didn’t file anything, and the agency already has the data. easy pickings.

what actually gets taxed depends on your country, but the usual story is the same. selling for fiat, swapping coin a for coin b, or spending crypto counts as a disposal. staking, mining, airdrops, yield, referral payouts, all usually hit as income at fair market value when you receive them. nft flips are typically capital gains. stablecoin interest is usually ordinary income. and if your records vanished with a dead exchange, it’s still on you to reconstruct cost basis.

the faceplants are also predictable. a 1099 or local equivalent isn’t “profit,” it’s gross proceeds or rewards. you still need cost basis to get to real gains or losses. people ignore coin to coin trades. they treat defi like a black box when swaps, providing and pulling liquidity, and wrapping can all be taxable events. privacy coins or mixers add privacy, they don’t grant legal immunity. and losing your seed phrase often means losing your paper trail too.

there’s a simple way to stay clean without losing your mind. list every venue you touched and pull the data early… csvs from exchanges, full on chain history for your addresses. rebuild cost basis using your jurisdiction’s rules like fifo or specific id. tag income correctly at value on receipt. mark self transfers so they don’t look like sales. reconcile year end balances to what your ledger says. save everything… tx hashes, screenshots, csvs… in a folder per tax year. tools help here..you can use a tool for that I personally use awaken to match on chain lots to exchange reports so my numbers aren’t vibes as it saves me a lot of time… use whatever you trust, just don’t wing it. if you messed up, amend sooner not later. if your setup is complex, a crypto literate tax pro is worth it.

you can still care about privacy the legal way. use fresh addresses for new contexts and avoid reusing receive addresses. self-custody is fine, just keep meticulous records. think twice about doxxing wallets with public usernames. if you touch privacy tools, know your local rules before you do.

The bottom line is…you can be pro-privacy and still pro-compliance. the chain is more transparent than people think and the tax machine is more automated than it used to be. if you like sleeping at night, treat crypto like any other investment or income stream… track it, report it, move on with your life.
not tax or legal advice… rules vary by country… talk to a professional for your specifics.",0.9959

This significant valuation gap, last seen in 2023, suggests a potential deep undervaluation. Analysts believe this could indicate an accumulation phase, with the possibility of a rally as market conditions stabilize. Factors such as reduced leverage, institutional inflows, and a rotation from gold to Bitcoin may drive the cryptocurrency's price closer to its fair value.

2025-10-25 01:47:13,Optimal_Store,post,My true thoughts on Cardano,ETH,"Long time holder here

Never thought I’d be writing this but here we are.

Cardano today is not where I thought it would be when I first bought in January 2021.

At the time we were sold on the idea that Cardano would “change the world” and that we would “bank the unbanked”

Today we are no closer to that vision in my opinion.

Don’t get me wrong. I’ve had some personal success working with projects early on writing content and such. It’s now my full time job.

But I’ve been immensely disappointed by progress on many fronts including scaling, native USDC, support for content creators like myself, and overall lack of support for builders.

I also thought that governance would be the thing that really brings Cardano forward. But it’s brought a ton of infighting

The community always seems to be fighting about what proposal gets funded and what doesn’t. And it’s exhausting. And demoralizing 

Catalyst, a grant fund, seems as though it’s been somewhat corrupted by people who know how to work the system to get money to fund unprofitable projects

But that’s a separate issue

I’ve been diversified out of Ada for a while now because of the above reasons and more.

I was a long time, hardcore advocate for Cardano in the early days especially in this subreddit. Now not so much.

In terms of Defi, the rest of the industry has surged way ahead of Cardano and it’s not even close. 

I’ve learned a lot since coming into crypto in 2019. 

I think the most important lesson I’ve learned is to just try everything and not lock myself down too hard into one place.

I’m grateful for all the opportunities I’ve been awarded nonetheless and especially grateful for all the friendships I’ve made.

At this point I can call some of them my fam.

Those are my raw thoughts on Cardano

Opti out 

Edit: for what’s its worth, I say this as someone who’s been deeply embedded in the Cardano community for a long time. 

What I say in this post is the current state of things. Who knows how things change in the future",0.9808

2025-10-17 14:20:05,MerkleChainsaw,post,Four year cycle update and what comes next,BTC,"Here's a table of BTC's price peaks. 

|Price Peak Date|Days Since Halving|Days Since Last Peak|Bear Drawdown|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nov 30, 2013|368||\-85%|
|Dec 16, 2017|525|1477|\-84%|
|Nov 9, 2021|547|1424|\-77%|
|Oct 7, 2025|535|1428|?|

In the short term BTC follows tech stocks and other factors, but long term the four year cycle has been surprisingly consistent. This could all be coincidence, but I think it's a self fulfilling prophesy at this point.

Especially given the recent price action, I think it's clear that the high for this cycle was October 7th. The returns between cycle peaks have been lessening over time, but the drawdowns in bear markets have been consistent, with price drops between 77% and 85% to the new lows. If that trend holds then BTC will go under $30K from here.

Maybe this time is different with tradfi involved, and maybe boomers (or taxpayers?) will hold everyone's crypto bags this time around. You should just know what you're up against holding BTC at this point in the cycle.",0.6553

\-there's more rate cuts on the horizon. It's not a simple ""priced in event"", since it's a longer term impact on liquidity and supply and demand.

\-M2 going up and historically being reliable in dragging BTC with it. Which has also a longer term impact.

\-gold is still rallying, for a good reason.

\-the stock market is still too greedy.

Also, for the bubble to pop, you first need a proper bubble. Remember what they say about market irrationality.

Ask yourself this:

Does it feel like things were feeling too bullish recently? Has the price gone way beyond conservative expectations? Was there a little too much fomo and mania?

At some point it will crash down, because like you said, cycles have been stronger than any other outside force.

2025-11-16 10:58:14,profShadow07,post,Today I almost lost my entire BTC stack because I thought I was “too smart” for a backup,BTC,"Today I met the dumbest version of myself.

When I first created my second passphrase wallet, I had that dangerous mix of confidence and laziness.
“I’ll remember this,” I told myself. “It’s easy, no need to write it down.”

So I didn’t.
And then, like an absolute genius, I sent most of my BTC stack to that wallet, because I wanted to retire the old one and “be more secure.”

Fast forward to today.

I sit down to create a new wallet and move some coins again. No big deal. I type in the passphrase, hit enter, and…

Wrong passphrase.

Okay, must’ve been a typo. I’ll type slower. Double-check every character. Again:

Wrong passphrase.

That’s the moment my body realised what my brain was trying hard not to process.
My breathing got heavier. My hands started shaking. Suddenly I could hear my heartbeat in my ears.

I tried again.
And again.
And again.

Same phrase. Same “I swear this is it” confidence. Same red error.

Then the real panic hit.

I started thinking about my wife. About how I’d have to walk up to her and say,
“Hey… you know all those years of saving, all the late nights, all the risk, all the belief? Yeah… it’s gone. Because I thought I was too clever to write down a sentence.”

I felt sick.
Genuinely sick.

I spent the next six hours in a kind of mental torture chamber.

Brute forcing my own brain.
Trying every variation I could think of.
Was there a dot at the end?
Did I use UK spelling or US spelling?
Did I capitalise that word?
Was there a space at the end?
Did I replace a word with a number?

Hundreds of attempts.
Same screen. Same error. Same sinking feeling.

At one point, my hands were shaking so badly I had to physically put the keyboard down and just breathe. I was whispering prayers under my breath like some desperate gambler trying to will the next spin of the wheel in his favour.

Then, somewhere between despair and autopilot, I tried the phrase again…

But this time I changed the case of the letters.
Same words, different capitalisation.

The wallet opened.

I just stared at the screen.
For a few seconds, I couldn’t even feel relief. It was like my brain needed a moment to reboot. Then it all hit me at once: the adrenaline, the exhaustion, the gratitude, the anger at myself.

I was this close to losing everything not because of a hack, not because of an exploit, not because “crypto is risky”…
…but because I was arrogant about a sentence.

Here’s what I learned today, and I’m writing this like I’m leaving a note to my future self:

	•	You are not smarter than entropy.

	•	You are not above making a tiny typo that destroys years of work.

	•	A single extra space, a capital letter, a dot at the end – that’s all it takes to turn your life savings into a permanent error message.

From now on, I don’t care how “easy” or “memorable” a passphrase feels.
I am writing it down. Properly. Backed up. Redundant. Stored safely.
Not because I’m paranoid – because I’ve now seen the version of me who almost had to tell his wife, “It’s gone.”

If you’re reading this and you’ve ever told yourself,

“I’ll remember it, it’s fine,”

No, you won’t.
You might. But you also might not. And that “might not” can cost you everything.

Today I got lucky.
Today was a warning, not a punishment.

I don’t think I’ll ever forget the feeling of that screen finally opening. But I also never want to be in a position where I have to rely on my memory like that again.

Write your phrases down.
Respect the dots, the spaces, the case, every tiny character.
Because they don’t just protect your wallet.
They protect your future self from the worst conversation you’ll ever have.",-0.6649

The drop was driven by institutional outflows, including $870 million pulled from Bitcoin ETFs, and significant liquidations of leveraged positions. Long-term holders sold 390,000 BTC since October, and exchange inflows spiked. Bitcoin is now below key technical thresholds, with analysts warning of further declines to support levels at $82,045 and $66,900.
